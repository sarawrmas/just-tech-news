Within a post, you can see how many comments are on a post and click the link to view comments. If you are logged in, you have the option to leave a comment.

Logged in users will see a link in the navigation called "Dashboard" which will take you to a page where you can view all of the posts that you've made and the option to create a new one.

Clicking the 'Edit post' link for a post in your dashboard will take you to a page where you can edit your title and/or body, add a comment, or delete your post altogether.
